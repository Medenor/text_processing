line = "So, Chris, we are going to try to tackle one of everyone's favorite topics with a variety of little case studies. Rather than tell the whole history of Berkshire or try to describe it in its entirety, which so many great books and podcasts and other things have done in the past, we'll try to focus on some very specific aspects of what make Berkshire so special and try to pull investing lessons out of the many activities of this fascinating company instead of investors. Buffett, most specifically. And I thought an interesting place to start would be float. People talk about float a lot as it relates to Berkshire it requires that we talk about insurance. It requires that we talk about the team behind all this and how it relates to the investing side of the business or the ownership side of the business. Maybe you can begin by just describing what Berkshire has taught the world about float and why it is so interesting and versatile. Float, as you know, and I'm sure most of your listeners know, is simply a net liability reflecting premiums that an insurance company has taken in advance of paying losses. And so you get the use of the capital for some period of time. Some lines of insurance are very short tail like auto, some lines like workers comp are very long tail. And so you better underwrite intelligently upfront because your losses can develop. In any event, Bertie's got 100 and almost $50 billion of float. You're starting with a funny question because they've taught the world, the world clearly understands that Berkshire is Berkshire. Because of the insurance operations started off the textile company, which Mr. Buffett bought in 1965, the textile company failed three of the first big businesses that Berkshire bought and used their stock for the initial acquisition of the textiles. But diversified retail and blue chip stamps essentially all went to zero. So Mr. Buffett has this unique ability to pivot, and his big first pivot was buying National Indemnity Small Insurance Company in Omaha 67. And with that insurance operation, the ability to incrementally invest portions of that float in common stocks over time, essentially having gotten out of the stock market in the late 1960s by stopping the inbounding of new client deposits in his partnership and eventually in 1969 getting all that money back. But he had this insurance operation that was able to, throughout the 1970s, the high inflationary 70s, was able to pick off some outstanding stocks. Washington Post Gillette bought a number of things that worked out really, really well. And for that, throughout the through the 80s, really until the very peak in Berkshire's multiple buck and the stock portfolio in the late ninety s, nineteen ninety eight, berkshire ran effectively a levered operation, if you will, by having more invested assets in the insurance operation than Berkshire itself had in book value. So you had about ten to 15% leverage in the portfolio. And for that, Berkshire by 1998 had clipped along at 28 or 29% return. Even if you met the leverage out that you got from having the insurance operation and the float in it, the stock picking was just superb, several percentage points ahead of the S and P 500 over decades. But you did have that leverage that you got from the ability to have flow. And so you've had all these copycats in the last 1015 years who have said, well, gosh, Berkshire has done so well having this insurance operation. Berkshire itself is a great way to have permanent capital. If you've got an insurance company, you've effectively got captive permanent capital. What the world realizes is insurance. Berkshires in the property casualty world, largely property casualty insurance and reinsurance. But even if you get into the life side of the insurance world, it's a terrible business. It is a horrible business. The aggregate of insurance underwriters no better than break even over time. The average, the median, will lose money over time on an underwriting basis. It was through Berkshire's discipline and also through generally successful operating, but ultimately, it was Berkshire's ability to walk away from business insurance, business premiums when it was badly priced, when it didn't make sense, you'd be hard pressed to find many or any insurers that have that discipline. And what's evolved is Berkshire has an enormous insurance operation, biggest in the world, but by far the best in the world. They have effectively three subgroups of insurance entities. Geico, that everybody knows that writes about 40 billion in premium. They've got a specialty business, BH primary with a series of subsidiaries, berkshire Hathaway Specialty, which they seeded a handful of years ago with a group that came out of AIG, all of their workman's comp business lines of insurance, a lot of excess and surplus lines. That group writes about 13 billion. And then you've got the reinsurance operation, the original national Indemnity, and then general reinsurance, which Berkshire bought in 98, and that group writes about 20 billion in premium. The world is lost on the notion that you can't offset Mediocre or bad industry with investments until you have massive surplus capital that allows you to invest in common stocks. And Berkshire is the only insurance company in the world. And by that, digging a little into the numbers and the weeds that I've talked about this before, and it was in my letter that I put it in my letter a couple of times. But if you think about how much capital is required to write business, which gives you the float to invest, start with the auto insurance business. It's very simple, very understandable. It's a very brutal, tough business. In auto, which is admitted, which means the state insurance commissions, bless you. You have to apply for the rate at which you can charge your customers. You have to be admitted into the state to write. You have to be approved by the insurance commissions. In private passenger auto, you can write $3 of premium volume for every dollar of statutory surplus, which is effectively book value for an insurance company. In GEICO's case, which writes 40 billion out of Berkshire's combined, $70 billion. Let's call it a premium. It only needs about $15 billion of surplus. I assign them 20 and assume they write it two to one. I've got another insurance company in my portfolio that writes two to one that has a whole bunch of surplus capital, but they're very conservative, and you can weather any kind of downturns in the insurance world where losses are developing quickly. And inflation aside, the good thing about auto is. It reprices very quickly. It's six month policies. Twelve month policies. If you've got high inflation now used car prices have been very high, you go back to your insurance commissioner and file for a rate increase. In any event, assign 20 billion of capital of surplus to the auto business. And then take that Berkshire Hathaway primary group, the specialty businesses. They write about 13 billion. You would give them about a buck in capital, but I go ahead and give them 20. So that's $40 billion of surplus that's assigned Berkshire in its entirety has almost $300 billion in insurance book value in statutory surplus. The reinsurance operation has $260,000,000,000. Of that, they write $20 billion in premium. The rest of the reinsurance industry globally, all the big guys, the biggest ones, munich Re, I believe, just passed Swiss Re for the title of largest premium volume. Well, that's not really a title you ever want to have, because, again, if you're in a market where you're not getting adequate premium, you're losing. So you've got the big Swiss Re, Munich Re, Manchester Re, that write more premium volume than Berkshire, but that group collectively writes about a dollar in premium for every dollar in capital. Swissery writes more. Munichi writes a little bit less. Manchester probably writes $0.50 on the dollar. The entirety of the insurance reinsurance industry globally writes about $300 billion in premium. So Berkshire writes I said 20 billion. So that's 7% of industry premium. The whole industry has 600, $650,000,000,000 in statutory surplus. Berkshire has 40% of the surplus, and they write 7% of the premium volume. And you'll see at times when they know business is not adequately priced, it can be wind, it can be any kind of big cats. Berkshire's content to sit there, not lay off their workforce when they shrink down, willing to see premium volumes drop by. And that's not the case. The Europeans, the Swiss and the municipal have never seen a premium they did not like. And for that, because every cycle when you have a big series of wind events or you have pandemic, you have losses develop badly for high inflation. Those guys are always having to recapitalize. They're always having to go back and raise new equity capital. They blow themselves up. When you have a really bad year, well, Berkshire, with that massive capital balance, never going to blow itself up. The whole entirety of the insurance operation pays cash losses every year for about $40 billion. You're never going to impair the balance sheet for that. Berkshire has what's now $320,000,000,000 stock, corporal. It's down about 20% this year as of today. But they've got the majority of their 500 billion, let's call it 450,000,000,000 of insurance reserves, investment assets sitting underneath, $150,000,000,000 in float invested in common stocks. Swissery, Munichery have 4%, 5% even really well run US insurers. Allegheny, which Berkshire is buying. They've got a 22 $23 billion investment portfolio, only three and a half billion at year end, as Western hex had it invested is invested in common stocks. Marquel 30 35%. Nobody has the majority of the capital, and that's the advantage. But so all of these cats come into the business and think, what a great way to get permanent capital? They come into an industry where it's really hard, if not impossible, to go get market share and make money. And they're all trying to grow and get bigger to get that float, but it blows up in their faces, and it just doesn't work. And I'm not sure anybody could do it today. Berkshire did it in a simpler time, in a time when the insurance industry was much smaller. And they did it at a time where you had a series of years and even decades where common stocks were generally cheap. But because Berkshire is an entirety it's entity, the insurance operation and the businesses outside of insurance, there's always money coming in the door, which is shrinking the current assets in the portfolio. And they've always got money to spend. And for that and for the underwriting discipline that Berkshire exhibits that none of the others do, they've got this massive float that sits under a much more massive investment portfolio and the ability to earn a common stock return on a portfolio versus the rest of the industry that's diminished to having to only earn a bond. Market return is night and day. You look at compounding at three to four to five to 6% premium, compound annual return on an investment portfolio over decades, and you're talking about just exponential differential in terms of the ability to grow your balance sheet and develop a fortress. Nobody else has the Fort Knox balance sheet. There's so many interesting points there, maybe most central of which is how unique this story is. So before coming back to the specifics around insurance and Berkshire specifically, we're writing Berkshire's history, let's say 50 years from now, for the period that Buffett was alive, let's say, and we were doing some sort of attribution exercise to say, okay, we've got 100 points to attribute here to sources of the reason for success for Berkshire's compounding success. How many of those hundred points do you think it allocated to this part of the story, to the creation of this unique float and insurance story inside of Berkshire, and that's much relative to others, which I'll come back to in a second. But is this one of the major explanatory reasons or is it even the most dominant explanatory reason that you think the history books will write when doing that 100 point attribution it truly is? Is it 50 points? Is it 70 points? Is it 30 points? Have fun with me. In the late 90s, when Berkshire bought January, berkshire was trading at almost three times book value. Today, it's trading at 130% of book. It was only worth half of where it was trading, but they had been rewarded for that 29% growth in book value per share for 30 plus years. The stock portfolio itself in the late 90s was massively overvalued. Coca Cola, which was 40% of the portfolio berkshire had made 13 X on Coke in a decade. It was trading at 50 times earnings. And so Mr. Buffett knew he had this high class problem, so he used Berkshire stock to buy general reinsurance, which effectively allowed him to acquire triple their float. They went from seven to $22 billion in float, but they also picked up an enormous amount of fixed income assets, sitting on top of Jennery's $6 billion premium book. By not paying capital gains taxes to shrink an equity portfolio, berkshire actually buys another insurance company using its stock as currency, trading at 200 cents on the dollar. A fair value effectively paid 22 billion when Berkshire itself was only worth eleven and was able to take the stock portfolio from 115% of book value. That's where that float was. The stock portfolio was about $37 billion, and they shrunk it down to 69% of book value on the closing of the genre deal. Genre brought 45% of the combined assets to the merger, and it was an entirely a stock based merger. Jan Re got 18% of the total shares outstanding. So Mr. Buffett knew that the float was not going to be a great thing at that point because it was trapped inside of an overvalued stock portfolio. And so the genius of them diversifying the bonds, allow them to go the following year and buy MidAmerican Energy, which has now grown via acquisition, but largely through retained profit. You've got a collection of utilities and energy distribution assets that don't pay dividends to Berkshire. They don't upstream their dividends. They reinvest all of that money in capital. So that's going to wind up being the second biggest business. They bought things like the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad in the wake of the financial crisis in 2009, and stole it. A business that they paid 35 or so billion dollars for in its entirety, that's now worth 100 and 2130 billion dollars. All profits there have been upstream to the parent. So Berkshire has diversified slowly and surely away from insurance being the cog, the key inside of the business towards now less than 50% of the business. Ten years out, 15 years out. If you think about where Berkshire's profitability comes from, and if you want to break down and get into the derivation of profits from the big moving parts from the energy business and the railroad, we can do that from their manufacturing service group. As I go through all the math, I get to about $50 billion in Berkshire annual profits, and I make a lot of adjustments to accounting to get to that number. But I think it's a very conservative number if you take the insurance operation. And this gets back to where Berkshire can be more conservative with their underwriting, because they've got this giant float balance, but they don't need it. Berkshire does not need to grow the premium volume, particularly in environments where it doesn't make sense, because if you're writing 70 billion, I presume they make about a pre tax margin on that underwriting. So that's three and a half billion net after tax would be about $2.93 billion. The investment portfolio, because it highly tilts toward common stocks and not fixed income, you've got this $320,000,000,000 stock portfolio, what's now 22 billion in bonds. They bought about 5 billion in bonds in the first quarter. And you've got cash that got whittled down from 90 billion to 55 billion or so because they bought Chevron when they bought the number of things in the first quarter when that spent about $40 billion in common stocks. You have this portfolio that when I think about where returns from the investments come from, from that common stock portfolio, I always presume that Berkshire is going to make the earnings yield. And I think those that follow the business understand the concept of what Mr. Buffett called for years, look through earnings, and that's essentially, Berkshire is going to get dividends. So on what's now $320,000,000,000 stock portfolio dividend yield, because the stocks are now down this year is up from one and a half to 1.7%. So your dividends are now five and a half billion dollars. But on the balance of that 320, you've got a portfolio that's traded down this year from over 19 times earnings to 15 and a half. And so collectively, between dividends and what I call the retained earnings that Apple keeps and reinvest, the Coca Cola keeps and reinvests, you've got a total of $21 billion now of investments. But that presumes a 6.2 or 6.3% earnings yield if you think the stock portfolio will earn more than that over time. And that's been about the average earnings yield on the stock market, on Berkshire's stock portfolio over a lot of years. Kind of a high teens multiple earnings, the six, seven, seven and a half percent earnings yield, the stock portfolio has done ten. The stock market has done more than that. So if the stocks inside of Berkshire's insurance operation, and that's where 95% of the stocks are, but if the portfolio does more than the earnings yield, which it has consistently over time, over longer periods of time, there's another ten, $15 billion in earnings that I don't capture in the 50. So even though Berkshire has intentionally not tried to grow the insurance book only in places where it makes sense. Geico is the second largest auto insurer in the country. They're running neck and neck with Progressive. They're both going to pass State Farm sometime here in the next couple, three years. You just don't have to get a lot bigger. And so for that, you weigh 3 billion net profit from underwriting against at least $21 billion, maybe as much as 30, $35 billion, depending on how the stock portfolio does over time, and it's the investment portfolio that drives the bus. So when you look at where Berkshire's returns have come from over time, they have largely, largely, largely, especially before they bought the energy operation and the railroad, it was really an insurance operation, less so today. But now you get these other diversified, very predictable earnings, streams of earnings coming into the business. So if, I guess, ten years out, I would guess, depending on how the stock market does and how Berkshire's stock portfolio performs, I don't think the insurance operation is going to shrink much. And the ability to invest float intelligently and not blow it up every time we have a bad period for underwriting, which everybody else tends to do, will allow Berkshire to compound and clip along at ten plus returns on equity. You break in the differential between earning five or 6% earnings yield and earning more on a stock portfolio return over time and you get the rough to 12%. Berkshire's total return on their stock is going to match the return on equity of the underlying business, and it's a net unlevered equity on top of that. So they run the thing extremely conservatively. Where debt exists in the operation, it's largely in the railroad, it's largely in the utility operations combined. You've got on the order of $110,000,000,000 in debt. 75 or so of that is in the railroad and the utility. That's not hypothecated to the parent, that's not Berkshire's obligation. But you've got a business where the right side of Berkshire's balance sheet, you've got 400 billion in change of shareholders equity, call it 400 and 2430, depending on where stocks are on any given day, but 110,000,000,000 in debt, which bears interest at maybe 3%. But that net float balance of $150,000,000,000, the underwriting profits of the insurance business earning three and a half billion pre 3 billion net, completely offsets the interest. So you've got the right side of this giant conglomerate balance sheet with more than $900 billion in assets, then on the right side have no net layout for expense. And that's just crazy. That's the flywheel. It's going to persist whether Mr Buffett's at the Tiller or Greg is running it, or whoever is running it, very hard to blow this thing up. So it seems like you didn't put a point total to it, but it's a high number. And is it even fair to say that the average impression of the lessons to take from Buffett's life and career in letters is what stuff to buy, what criteria to use to buy stuff, when maybe the real story is where to get the capital to buy that stuff with? Do you think that that's the fundamental misunderstanding of the key lesson of Berkshire? I think it's really well put. It is, don't blow yourself up. When you buy assets, understand what you own. You look at the common stock investments, these things are not cute you're not trying to find some Romanian pharmaceutical company that's got a couple of phase two trials that we might get something. You've got very known, predictable earning power that you're not going to expose the company to impairment. But it's this notion that by retaining profit in a place where you can retain it and invest it well over time, I think that's a huge advantage to Berkshire that most companies don't enjoy. Very few public companies genuinely have the opportunity set to retain profits and have places to put the money. So what they do is they acquire badly overpay. The average CEO is on the job for four or five years. You've got a high motivation to get the stock price up. You've got a high motivation to have a higher, larger top line, because executive comp is often driven on the size of the company. We had the big tax code change, for example, back at the end of 2017, and we lowered the marginal tax rate from 35% to 21%. We had all of these incentives in place to use accelerated depreciation where a business could spend capex and immediately write it off for tax purposes in year one. Eventually, you're going to pay the tax over time, but down the road, you've got a time value of money. You didn't see a lick of increase in capex. You've not seen a lick of increase in R and D, because these businesses don't, in aggregate, find the businesses that can do this, but find the places that can retain profit intelligently at high returns on capital. I look at Berkshire. If you've got $50 billion in economic earning power today on a business that now has a market cap of 600 billion, let's call it, and trading at twelve times earnings on 50 billion, you're trading at 600, you're trading at twelve. You've got an 8.3% earnings yield. To me, the best way to explain Berkshire and the advantage of it is it's a bond, where as an acquirer of Berkshire is a shareholder buying shares today at an 8.3% earnings yield. When Berkshire's buying stock back at today's price, they're buying it at 8.3%. But the entirety of their profits that are retained after taxes are paid by Berkshire are being reinvested at ten to 12%. That's still the hurdle rate that's on the 30 year bond. I did some math on the 30 year. I think I identified the worst performing bond in the history of the United States government bond. They issued a 2% in 2020 on 215 20, and it traded up as interest rates dropped during the Pandemic to 120. That thing is now in the low 70s. It's lost 40% of its price. And so you bought that thing at the peak, you bought it at 120. You're making two coupons. You're going to lose 20 points to maturity. You're going to mature. At par, you're investing at two. But every time you get your coupon payments, semiannual coupons 1% every six months. If you're going back into the bond market, you're buying whatever the current yields are. So if interest rates average two or three or 4%, you're starting off at two and you're buying at two and three. In Berkshire's case, you're buying it at eight. Three, they're reinvesting it at ten to twelve, and they have a durable set of places to go invest the money and not blow it up. And nobody does that. Nobody does that. There's just such a need to spend the media and these bluebirds that watch Berkshire and Lament over this enormous cash balance, why can't they spend it? Why can't they spend it? They'll spend it on their time and they'll lay it out on very attractive terms, and they're not going to put it in places that are going to blow it up. There's no incentive for the management of the company to get bigger without getting bigger on a profitable basis. Management makes $100,000 salaries. They have never given a single stock option or restricted share, not only to Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, but to anybody. The Board of Directors paid $2,000 a year for a retainer. And if you chair a committee, you make six grand. There's no DNA insurance policy. I mean, you don't go to Berkshire's board to get rich. You go there to preserve the culture of a place that you've laid out a bunch of your own money to own the stock. Every one of the directors on Berkshire's board has big time investments in shares of Berkshire that they all paid for themselves. And so you've got this culture that allows management to be intelligent and rational with capital. And frankly, when you make mistakes and they've made plenty of mistakes over the years, precision cast parts being the most obvious front and center, when they overpaid for a business that was already in trouble, they've written that asset down by $10 billion. But the mistakes that are made over time because you're not distributing dividends to shareholders and this capital base continues to grow, and it's growing in these very predictable earnings streams. The mistakes become smaller and smaller. They become rounding errors. A lot of people admit you don't get any information on sea's candy anymore, which is a great business, but it doesn't matter. They're the big levers of where the economic durable profitability comes from. And those are not in places that are at risk to disruption, that are just generally not at risk. And so this thing will continue to march ahead. That will drive forward like an aircraft carrier will. It'll turn very slowly. But it's about as indestructible of business as you're going to find in scale and other handicapped by large numbers. These are huge numbers we're talking about. It's the biggest company in the world. By tangible assets, by fixed assets. Again, $900 billion plus. Look under the hood at the sources of earning power, which originally came from that float. Which in part still come to the float. But now it's that float that's allowed them to diversify into these other very predictable, regulated, big businesses, and it's just going to wind up being a bigger business. It's not going to deviate much from the path of its own. I think about it sometimes as the business or the story that launched a million holdcos. There's a siren song of, oh, I want to run a holdco and have some permanent capital and be a stock picker. And I think what history teaches us is there actually are a lot of really good stock pickers. There's plenty of people you can point to and say they've out compounded the S and P, they've done whatever, done it concentrated, done it with great businesses, etc. E but there's basically no other stories like this one. I guess my question is understanding how unique the float and insurance story is inside Berkshire and the importance of the discipline of the investment and how bad the insurance competitors are. And therefore, like that creates the initial separation, and that separation compounds over time. It's an incredibly compelling story. It still strikes me as odd that we have a universe of stock pickers who are good, but we don't have a universe of hold codes where good stock picking inside of them would lead to a great outcome. Any other thoughts on why that is the case, why that is the record that disparity? I think it's a fluke of time. It's a fluke of the alignment of discipline and intelligent capital allocation that nobody else had, just this odd structure that even Mr. Buffett has said he could redo it. He would not have done this thing inside of a holding company, wouldn't have bought the textile company, could have done a lot better as a stock picker outside of this platform. The advantage is they did it 50 years ago, 55 years ago, and you can't do it again today. Those that try just fall flat on their faces. Markel is a very good business. Allegheny is a very good business. But they're only in the early innings of being able to do this, and you just don't have the wild disparities in terms of the ability to pick stocks as cheaply as they were. You go back to 1982, the overall stock market traded at seven or eight times earnings on a 3% profit margin. They were trading at 2020 5% of sales. You can access that today. The fluke of having float underwriting discipline that nobody else exhibited. Berkshire's had really bad underwriting periods where they led underwriting losses, but there was always enough surplus capital because of the way they did it in the first ten and 15 and 20 years that it never put the business at harm. They've never had to go to the capital markets ever and raise new equity capital. The only time Berkshire has used its share is an acquisition, and generally when it's expensive. The only times they've bought back the stock in the late 1960s and portion of the 1970s, recently here in the last three or four years, buying back over $60 billion. They've only bought it back when it's trading at a material discount to intrinsic value. Very few have been able to do that. Singleton did it at Paradigm to a degree, but they didn't have the culture and the durability of some of the businesses, some of the defense businesses, but they don't suffering. You really didn't have the instinct and the know how to when you lay capital out. You're buying things that are just durable within the stock portfolio and the wholly owned companies. And it doesn't mean they're all great inside of their manufacturing service retail group. You have a lot of businesses that don't have the ability to retain capital. And the premise had generally been when Mr. Buffett bought a Dexter or International Dairy Queen or NetJets or Executive Jet, any of those businesses, they would generally upstream their profits to the holding company for redeployment elsewhere. Again, the railroad has never retained a dollar of capital because it really didn't have use for much more than adding in very low cost debt capital would allow them to do. The railroad was spending $2 in Capex for every dollar in depreciation for the first ten years. The Berkshire owned it because they had a lot of places to improve the infrastructure of that business. They've done that. They've blown out the tunnels. They've created corridors going into urban areas where you had three wide track. Now you've got six and twelve wide. You've got the ability to run intermodal and containers stacked on your entire network, but the route network hasn't changed from 32 0 mile at all, but they've improved the network. But a lot of that's already run its forces. And all of a sudden, the cadence of Capex there has dropped from two times depreciation to one and a half. And in the railroad, for all kinds of reasons, maintenance Capex is more than depreciation charges. So you're really almost in a state of stasis now there. But again, with the energy operation that retains all $4 billion that Berkshire makes, and the way utilities are capitalized, you generally have about as much debt in the capital structure as you do equity. So when they retain for, they add another four in debt at very low cost terms. You're not paying dividends to shareholders. And they really do have a very long runway to spend what I call growth Capex there. So it's this knowledge at the headquarters of where money can get reinvested intelligently and where it can't, and maybe even to a fault, some of those businesses that were bought and reside inside that manufacturing service retail group, it's almost easy. If you're 70 years old and you sell your business to Berkshire for all the reasons you want a home for your people and your business, you don't want to be disruptive. And that was very true for a long time, but I think it was just very easy to send money to Omaha and not lean on this notion that if you're not growing, you're dying. I think it was too easy to send the profits and not look for intelligent places to make bolt on acquisitions and to grow or to spend capex to grow the top line. It's all about the return on capital and the return on the price that was paid for the business. And if it's generating good, healthy profits, we'll send them all to Omaha. My guess is, with Greg Abel now involved in running effectively all of the businesses overseeing he's not running him, but he's overseeing all of the businesses that are not insurance. He's really rolled up his sleeves and gotten involved in the businesses. And a lot of the folks that I've talked to in the virtual world rave about his comprehension of economics of their businesses. And my guess is I think they're going to find places with which to lay out more of that capital that comes in. It seems like so much of this idea of durability is the reinvestment capacity of the business. And I'm curious what you think Berkshire's lens and your own lens developed in your investing career is on that word, durability. I guess if the answer was simple, everyone would just buy the durable businesses. So it's obviously, by definition, hard. But what do you think are the signposts of durability in a business that Berkshire respects or has come to respect, and maybe that you come to respect as you evaluate companies that were durable and the reinvestment capacity just seems like in addition to the float story that we talked about, those seem to be two pillars of success that are unavoidable in any way. You tell the Berkshire story. So maybe just say a little bit more about evaluating for durability ahead of purchase and monitoring that as you own. A great example of that would be for decades, you heard Mr. Buffett say, we don't invest in tech because I don't understand it. He genuinely was correct, and he knows where his circle of competence is. Understands the ravages of disruption. You're on the bleeding edge of technology. Probably didn't own Microsoft because he got too close to Bill Gates, who sat on the board for a long time, tried IBM, thought that was the server business, was predictable. Burned his hand a little bit on the hot stove. But when he was able to get $36 billion invested in Apple, he pointed out, I realized this really isn't a tech company anymore. It's really a consumer products company that has a moat. Because once you're in the Apple architecture and you've got your phone and your iPad and your notebook, your desktop, you're not leaving the architecture. It's just you're too wed to it. And so I think he realized, good Lord, not only is this a very predictable growing business, a noncnon disruptable earnings stream. It's not going to be a BlackBerry, but I can get it at twelve to earnings. So it's also the discipline to only buy things when they're very, very, very cheap. If you think about a recent example of what typifies Berkshire's process is, allegheny, maybe you mention that name a few times. Now, a good case study to understand, one, how the process works, how an asset might be evaluated, but then also to how certain assets might be better inside of an ecosystem like what Berkshire has built. Do you think that that's a useful case study? That's a great case study. The last thing Berkshire needs is to go layer on a bunch of new insurance premium. Again, they write what they write. They write it intelligently. They write 70 billion Allegheny between their collection of three insurance companies, transri, which writes about five. You've got RSUI, which is a gym of a wholesale specialty, underwriter earns 15 points underwriting margin consistently over time. They've just been a phenomenal business. A little thing called Cap Specialty, which writes specialty business for small and midsized businesses. But combined, they write about $7 billion. So Berkshire's going to wind up growing their insurance premium by seven. You think about how insurance companies outside of Berkshire work. Swiss Re and Munich Re can write as aggressively premium volume relative to their surplus. You have to lay off a lot of business in the reinsurance world. You have to go to the retrosessional markets. Berkshire has underwritten big insurance policies. Berkshire's reinsurance Operation Force, Whistle and Municipry, they have underwritten some reinsurance for transcripts by being owned inside of Berkshire. That collection of three insurers will not need to go to at all or as aggressively to the retrosessional market because of Berkshire's fortress balance sheet, they can retain all of that premium volume they write, which makes it more profitable. When Berkshire bought Jenner in 98, genre had a history of about a 1% underwriting loss over time. But they had to shed so much of the business that they wrote, because they only had so much capital inside a Berkshire, they've been able to retain all of that business, and genre became immediately and durably more profitable being inside of the business. Allegheny operated with about two and a half billion dollars that operates the deal is not closed yet. It should be. A fourth quarter of this year deal operates with about two and a half billion of net debt. Again, we talked about where the debt exists in Berkshire's operation. The portion on the right side of the balance sheet, that's not in the railroad utility. It's not if it's in the insurance operations. Some of that debt sits at the holding company, but the insurance companies are run with zero debt on the balance sheet. So Berkshire will eliminate that two and a half billion dollars and they'll run it unleashed. I've gotten to know Western Hicks, who just retired as Allegheny CEO really well. He's become a very good friend of mine. He was just a great CEO. For those that aren't familiar with Allegheny or Westin, his CEO letters to the shareholders in the last 15, 1617 years are absolutely worth reads if you're learning about insurance, learning how to invest, if you like humor. Westerns were just great. But Allegheny was building a I hate the term, but many Berkshire, markel is doing the same thing. And so as they started developing surplus capital, as our Sui in particular, was so profitable, but as Transri was writing well, they were able to divert some capital to wholly owned businesses. Berkshire is famous for not only having the common stock portfolio, but all of these businesses that are wholly owned as operating subsidiaries inside of the conglomerate. They had taken about 1.3 billion in capital and bought a series of private businesses that collectively have been good businesses. They were paying some guys, a couple guys finder fees, if you will, commissions that for the first few years would match the profitability of one of those deals that they did. But that group here at year end was doing eleven points. Twelve points on equity, generally unlevered. But Weston would lament having to now compete against private equity and all of this money that's sloshing around, and even to compete against Mark Allen deals. The control premiums required to buy a business in the last couple of three years have been so high that it's not worth doing it inside of Berkshire. There's no need for that function to exist. The capital exists at the holding company level. There's no need to grow. The Allegheny Capital Book of private businesses, and that's an advantage. You think about the type of reinsurance operation that Transree is about three quarters, let's say, if their business is proportional or quota share, where you share a portion of your prorata share the premium, but you also prorata share the losses as they develop with whoever is feeding the policy to you. You can cap that. They can be uncapped. But in that world, about three quarters of business, like I say, was proportional. And we've had a series of really bad years for losses. A lot of wind and a lot of fire. And then you had the pandemic where you had losses for the COVID They were getting so much price on property that in proportional insurance, you tend to not see the profitability for twelve months, 18 months. And so Mr. Buffett understands that that profitability is going to endure. Now for Berkshire's shareholders, and the price paid was very low for it. The huge advantage is this point about float and surplus capital, which Berkshire has, that Allegheny did not have to the same extent. Again, on a 22 $23 billion investment portfolio, that's probably now 20, because interest rates have risen and the bonds are down. Western only had three, and a half billion dollars invested in stocks that you're in a small percentage of the total of 22 or 23. Berkshire, over time, will flip that, and they'll have 1617, $18 billion of the reserves of the $13 billion in float. They'll have more than the float invested in common stocks. And you think about the difference of earning a high single digit return on common stocks again, versus a bond portfolio earning four on that size of operation. That will add $600 million of investment earnings to Berkshire's benefit that Allegheny could not realize because of the limitations on owning common stocks given the size of their operation. That's huge. And then the real intangible is going to wind up being, I believe, gentleman named Joe Brandon had run Jen Rie following Ted Montrose. Joe's a really good insurance executive. He's phenomenal. I've gotten to know him a little bit. Not near the degree that I know Weston, but back in the financial crisis, AIG and National Indemnity did a retroactive deal policy, a big insurance policy. When AIG got in trouble, the government insisted that this was not a legitimate investment insurance transaction. It was really effectively a loan they insinuated. There was not a conveyance of risk. Well, the government put a lot of pressure on Berkshire. AIG really was in trouble. They got massively recapitalized. Of course, the government took him into receivership. And so Mr. Buffett let Joe Brandon go, sacrificed him as the head of January West, and intelligently picked up Joe later to help run the collective insurance operation. Ultimately, Joe was absolutely vindicated. It was demonstrated there was conveyance of risk. It really was a retroactive policy as best as losses that would develop over time. And so they've patched up the relationship, obviously. And I know they were meeting in 2019 to do a deal. transge was doing a deal with Berkshire. And I think you talk about succession. We all know Greg Abel is going to run the operations of Berkshire, and he'll be the CEO, ajit. Jain for those that know Berkshire, obviously everybody knows Ajit. Mr. Buffett goes on and on about Berkshire wouldn't be Berkshire without his skill as an underwriter and his brain. I think Joe ultimately, at the point, if Ajit. Were to slow down or retire, I think he becomes a very, very good succession plan. And I think that was probably top of mind when the transaction was done. But Berkshire is paying $11.6 billion for 9 billion in equity. And again, but this big, big investment portfolio of $22 billion that you would do all the math on, all the benefits of Allegheny being run inside of Berkshire versus not in. Berkshire is paying seven times earnings thereabouts for the business, and it will be a better business inside of Berkshire, even though in the grand scheme of $11 billion transaction, it's a rounding error for a business that's worth 900 plus billion and has booked value of over 400. But the additive premium volume profitably developing inside Berkshire is good for the company, and again, it gives them another 17, 1819 $20 billion to dedicate to the common stock portfolio that just perpetuating flywheel. If we think about energy and the role that it plays in Berkshire's whole story, especially today, I think it's a really fascinating story that I'd love you to pick apart for us, and especially because my impression of energy as a business is that it's very hard and maybe even very bad in some ways, generally. Like you said, insurance is very bad, especially in oil and gas, for example. You're a price taker. There's crazy swings. There's tons of cyclicality. There's tons of wash outs, constant bankruptcies. It's been a brutal cycle for energy businesses until very recently. Tell me what you've learned about energy. Visa. Visa, Berkshire. What kinds of energy businesses can be good, why Berkshire has assets in this space. Yeah, give us a crash course on the role that energy and energy assets play today. Well, it's a big role and a growing role inside Berkshire. So Berkshire bought Mid American Energy again right after the genre deal. That was their first electric utility. They've since bought two big others, nevada Power and Pacific Corp. So they've got a big footprint in the Midwest and in the west, again, with the retention of all profits, which is totally different than the way an electric utility operates. Most publicly traded utilities distribute the majority of their profits to shareholders as dividends. They're income animals. They were widows and orphans stocks. These are regulated utilities. Most electric utilities operate with a monopoly in their regions or in their states. They're highly regulated by their states. They're regulated by FERC. And so you're allowed to earn, as an electric, return from your rate based on your equity capital, kind of depending on where interest rates are in today's world, electrics are allowed to earn high single digit returns on equity capital spend. You think about it, the utility exists if it's monopoly, and it's highly regulated. They exist for public good. If we have a growing population and we need more power, we need more megawatts of power, nobody's going to build in a commodity world unless they're assured of getting a reasonable return on any money spent. And so for that, they're benefited with things like the use of accelerated depreciation on the front end, where you get an immediate tax benefit for money laid out. If you're going to spend three or four or $5 billion on a plant, a nuclear plant, you've got to get a return on it. And some regulators are kind of funky about these things. As we've been transitioning to renewables, we're going to wind up with some stranded assets. But in Berkshire's world, on the power production side between these three utilities, they have been making massive, massive investments in wind and solar and the grid that's necessary to distribute these geographically disparate, nonconstant sources of power. Huge investments, $18 billion in the middle of building the grid out for what they've spent so far, and it's an investment in wind of almost $35 billion. Berkshire has more renewable production when you take the collection of their three utilities than any other utility in the United States, they have half of their power production now coming from wind solar, the hydro that exists in the Northwest. With Pacific Corp. And big runways to spend continuous money, a lot of the wind will likely have run its course in part by 2024. But in the solar production in the Southwest, where the sun shines a lot, you have a lot of desert and uninhabited land. Solar is going to be a bigger footprint. Berkshire has taken a very clean, carbon friendly approach to power. They've closed 16 or 17 of their coal fired plants. They're in the process between now and 2030 of closing, another 16. They'll have 14 left that they'll have finally closed by 2040. And so the size and the scope of the operation with 40 billion in equity capital earning ten plus on equity capital, they've got a beautiful collection of assets. They've got, again, a bunch of pipelines they've picked up. They bought a pipeline from Williams. Williams Companies, the big pipeline business distribution company, got in big trouble. Before the financial crisis, Berkshire made what some would call a Usury. Loan to Williams to keep them out of bankruptcy of 30 something percent. I think it was a 37% loan. And, oh, by the way, we'll take your current river pipeline, which is probably the best pipeline in the country. They bought several assets from Dominion a couple of years ago, spent $8 billion on a series of pipelines on the East Coast and running through the middle of the country, picked up an LNG distribution terminal. Some of these are in joint ventures, but on the power side and the distribution of natural gas side, wonderful collection of assets. Then in the energy world, you have recent investments in companies like Chevron and Oxy. Antidarcho was in the process of being acquired by Chevron. Oxy entered a bidding war and came in and topped the offer. Chevron wound up getting a breakup fee, but to finance the deal, Oxy needed some cash. So Vicky Holland Vova kind of said, you ought to go talk to Mr. Buffett, and he may be interested in doing a deal with you. Berkshire wound up investing $10 billion in a preferred, provided the liquidity that Oxford needed to do that deal, perhaps overpaid for the deal, perhaps not, but preferred, you're sitting above the equity class, and they got an 8% premium on $10 billion or 8% coupon on $10 billion. So $200 million quarterly distributions. And this is going to be an example of the ability to change your mind. If you think at 91 years old, I know a lot of inflexible investors that get stuck in a mindset, and they do things their way, and they don't acknowledge when they've made mistakes. It's hard for them to go think outside the box and find new things. But I'm not sure, post Pandemic, that Berkshire had a lot of interest in having a big exposure in oil and gas. To your point, on the oil and gas side of the energy world, terrible industry, historically cyclical to all get out. Classic capital cycle. You make a bunch of money. All these wildcatters come in. Everybody spends money. From 2012, 1314, exxon and Chevron were spending on the order of $40 billion. And they overbuilt productive capacity. They were over drilling. And you created way too much equipment, service equipment, and you just had this orgy of spending, and all of a sudden, things blew up. Post 2015, oil traded below 100, and you eviscerated assets. You eviscerated capital, a lot of bankruptcies. And in the wake of that, Chevron and Exxon have ruled up a lot of independent power producers. Again, the Anadarko deal that oxygen, you've now got a lot of concentration of land and assets in places like the Permian Basin and a much more rational approach to oil and gas. And so we have created some scarcities. Semper bought a couple of refiners in October of 2020. Refining is very cyclical. It's a spread business. You take a barrel of crude oil, unrefined crude, run it through your refiners, you create everything that comes out of the stack, from kerosene to gasoline to all of your distillates, so diesel and jet fuel. All of your feedstocks that wind up in petrochemicals, so polyethylene, all the way down to things like asphalt and lubricants and waxes. We have been taking, we being the west, europe has been closing refining capacity for 30 years. In the United States, we've closed refining capacity. We've taken the number from 250 something down to 127 refiners. But in the United States, unlike Europe, as our population was growing, we were adding to refining capacity. So even though we were closing the net number of refineries, the current ones were adding capacity. They were adding stacks and crackers, what have you, until about four years ago. And the world has gone down the path of green. There's a lot of people that believe that we're just going to do without oil and natural gas. Well, that's an impossibility. We may have more electric vehicles, but you're not going to do away with jet fuel. You're not going to do away with asphalt. You're not going to do away with plastics. You're not going to do away with almost everything that comes out of the stack. Globally, we've closed probably 3 million barrels of refining capacity net since prior to the pandemic, since 2019. And if the world does 100 million barrels of supply demand, closing three of refining capacity now, you wonder why gasoline prices are high. You wonder why we have a lot of high prices. So I think Berkshire's realized that we have scarcities in a lot of places and you cannot on a dime build another refinery. You can't take the ones that are closed and California has just closed three of them in the last two years. They're front and center in creating the problems that we have. You're just not going to bring this stuff on any time soon. So things are very, very tight. This is not a Putin inflation that we've got. This is a scarcity of assets. You've also got a rationality of production because when you have elected officials in Europe and the United States pointing a finger at the oil and gas industry and saying we are going to put you out of business, you might have an aversion to spending money on growth. Capex and so we have a very real scarcity here and I think Mr. Buffett got that. And so again, watching a guy change his mind when Berkshire got the initial $200 million quarterly dividends from Occidental, oxy had the option to pay those dividends in common stock or to pay those dividends in cash. When they were in the process of not knowing how low oil prices were going to go, they had taken on a lot of debt on the balance sheet to finance the Anadarko deal and so they were a little bit handicapped in terms of flexibility on capital allocation. And so it made more sense to distribute shares, 200 million dollar quarterly shares to Berkshire. Berkshire sold those shares in the teens and the here we are a year and a half, two years later and Berkshire makes a big common stock investment in Occidental in the high fifty s per share. When they did the preferred, the $10 billion preferred at 8%, they also got a bunch of warrants to buy the stock at 58 or $59.80 something million shares. But here you are. Now adding to that position in the comment, I think that goes to this belief now that even though you've got what are classically pretty bad industries when you find places like Scarcity, it's also the flexibility to lay money out, albeit perhaps not for a long term permanent hold and make some money. Now, some have asked whether Berkshire might buy all of Occidental and I don't think they would with one caveat. Oxy is developing a huge carbon capture operation. Carbon capture done by all the big majors. We own Ecuador, which is the old Stat oil in Norway. We do own ExxonMobil. So when you have a field that you are depleting now you've got effectively this giant hole in the ground. You can take carbon from things like the manufacturer of cement, capture the carbon, inject it into the well and effectively create these solidified carbon reserves and take the carbon out of what would otherwise be going into the atmosphere. It's kind of genius. It's very expensive technology, but we're doing it for tax reasons. Berkshire's investments in wind and solar are very highly tax subsidized. Their tax rate is a negative 40%. The benefits from that spending are a social good. We've determined that wind and solar are social good, just like building a coalfired plant back in the day, building a natural gas fired plant. These things exist for the public good, and for that, we have public policy that rewards companies that are willing to lay out the capital, virtually benefiting. If Oxy can do, on the scale that they're talking, a massive carbon capture operation, it will be highly tax subsidized. And if you follow the history of Berkshire, you'll find that a lot of the investments that they've made over the years come with a twist of being very tax beneficial. Berkshire pays a lot of taxes. They're one of the largest tax paying entities in the world. But they're also pretty savvy when it comes to understanding the underlying net of tax economics of making investments. If you step back from all of this, I think this has been a really fun way to explore Berkshire in the specifics, not in the general. But maybe as we wrap up thinking a bit more generally, I have a two part question. You can take them as one question. How do you think about, then, today, the major pieces that Berkshire, the company, is? We've talked about insurance and energy and Apple a little bit, and the investment portfolio. The Apple position is more than $100 billion, which is just remarkable. I don't know what their cost basis is, but that's an incredible investment. How do you think about the major pieces that drive it from here? And then there's the obvious necessary question, which is, it's run by two very old gentlemen who at some point, sadly, will no longer run Berkshire. And as a longtime investor in Berkshire, how do you then think about the nature of it as an investment with those parts that you'll outline in mind moving forward? If you take the big moving pieces to your earlier question as well, that kind of ties into this question. This is very noble. You can be more confident what Berkshire is going to look like ten years out. Then you can be with most businesses. Consumer durables staples are fairly predictable. But in Berkshire's world, the big moving parts now are some of these assets that they've bought after they diversified away from insurance. With the genre deal, the railroad, you're doing $7 billion in profits. Nobody's going to displace. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe. They exist in the west with Union Pacific. They're almost identical looking companies. They have the exact same number of route miles, nearly the exact same number of employees. The economics of the businesses are very similar. We've got 7 billion earning power there, all the profits going to the parent. That thing will grow in line with GDP, but you'd be hard pressed to say the railroads going to get disrupted by electric trucks. I mean, that notion that we're going to have all these trucks driving around without drivers. Maybe, but isn't that what a train is? We kind of invented trains 150 years ago. 200 years ago, you've got the energy operation that does 4 billion, retains all that money, has a very long runway to spend on renewables, to spend on distribution assets. They will continue to make acquisitions in that space. And those are assets that are going to earn ten to eleven on equity capital. Very predictable. The ability to spend money on capex there on a durably long basis means that a decade from now, seven years from now, the thing will be doing 8 billion. It's going to be larger in the next few years than the railroad. Those two pieces are very noble. You can take a comp on the railroad for what it's worth and compare it to a Union Pacific that was trading at its highs of 160 or 170,000,000,000. I carry it at $120 to $130,000,000,000 value. The energy operations worth 70 or $80 billion, it's going to be worth twice that within ten years. You've got this vast array of manufacturing, service, retail businesses that are markedly improved in the last few years, I think under the closer watch of Greg, but they throw off $11 billion in free cash. That group runs net unlevered, so it earns what's now a high single digit return on equity, but there's no debt. And you take this collection of old businesses assets like Marvin and the precision Castparts, lubrazol, Johns, Manville Shaw, a lot of housing assets. There's this wild collection of just disparate entities that have some retail, they've got some service aspects, but that thing goes over $150,000,000,000 in revenues and throws off 11 billion in profit. And I think the ability to maybe sell some of those operations that are underperforming, find a few things that you can buy. If we get some kind of pullback here in private equity and valuations come back down to reality. But that's a very predictable $11 billion, and it's an acceptable, adequate return on unlevered equity. And then the insurance operation, we've covered fairly in depth here. It's just going to be bigger over time because they're just not at risk to blowing themselves up with the Fort Knox balance sheet they have. And so I sleep really well at night. And when you try to buy the thing for less than what it's worth and try to buy it at increasing discounts, I'm not sure you're going to find a better business. The ability and the need of replacing the capital, allocator that sits at the top of that company becomes incumbent. And I think Greg will do a great job. But then years down the road, you've got to replace Greg. And so the role of that board of directors is going to be increasingly important under the guide of Mr. Buffett. He ran the business. He can be chairman and CEO. This proposal to separate the role of chairman and CEO was insane. They're going to separate that role when he's no longer running the company. But you wouldn't remove it from this gentleman in the way that this organization has been run for the benefit of the shareholder and the benefit of the employees for all these years. The morality, the ethics, the accounting that's practiced. It's not aggressive. You don't hear about things like adjusted EBITDA. It's just going to be a bigger business. And so that board's role is going to be preserved the culture and keep these vultures of some of the activists out of the affairs, because, left alone, perpetuating the ability of Berkshire to retain its profits and find places to intelligently invest it durably and in places where you're not going to light it on fire is really what will sustain. It trades at a remarkable discount to what you'd call intrinsic value relative to the overall stock market. And I think for that, it's been misunderstood, but it sits at a very, very high portion of the top of my portfolio because of all these things we're talking about, it's the most predictable earnings stream that I know is going to be managed with Karen caution by Mr. Buffett and all of his successors. If you just had to reflect back, obviously, you've been a big shareholder, you've been a big learner. You've been one of the people that's explained Berkshire in more detail to more people than probably anybody else. And imagine a world in which Berkshire had never existed in your life, and then compare that to this world where it did. What do you think it has taught you? I don't want to complicate the question more than that about investing in business writ large that is most important. I think it's the golden rule. Patrick and I put Costco in the same bucket, but Berkshire goes out of its way to take care of its customers, take care of its employees, take care of its regulators, and these highly regulated businesses where they exist. Work fairly with suppliers, work fairly with the other insurance companies that you're doing reinsurance business with to treat your customers fairly at Geico, take care of the communities in which you live. You've got this culture of a cult where the shareholders get it. Costco has a similar cult, and at the end of the day, the shareholders take care of you. Just don't have a 57 year history of accounting abuses, of write offs and write downs. The decision making that's taken place is extremely conservative. It's unique that it's not adopted by more companies, but it's a long time horizon. I use these types of businesses like Berkshire and Costco as the standard of how to behave, and we're looking for management teams that behave similarly, that run the business for the benefit of the shoulder. A lot of times, those are founders or owners or it's folks that think that way. Berkshire is not about making a quick buck too many companies are. And when you run a thing without debt and you never expose it to the worst of economic downturns, you have thick enough skin to not chase high tech in the late 90s because a lot of your shareholders think you could, to not chase the next dollar of insurance premium because you have this need to be bigger every quarter and every day. GE's had a big, big finance operation, obviously, and they had a big reinsurance company. And when your culture is, you gotta make the quarter, and you spend all your time with the sell side analytical community ensuring they understand how much you're making and ignore the leverage and ignore the off balance sheet liabilities, but we're going to make the number well, unconditionally. Your charge was to get bigger, and so you would take the next dollar of premium volume. And when you were writing bad business, whether you're writing it or not, you didn't want to face the wrath of Jack. Berkshire is the polar opposite, and I think if the folks that wind up running it down the road can maintain that discipline and maintain that culture, even though it's a giant organization, it can continue to be a more giant organization. And as long as the stock stays cheap, there's really no need to grow, because the business can buy back the shares when they're cheap. Again, the distinction of only buying them when they're cheap versus buying them to offset the dilution that comes on the front end of giving management boatloads of stock options and restricted shares, it's just a different culture. It's a different mindset. It really has been run for the shareholder. It's extremely tax efficient. Again, as a taxable investor, for my taxable portfolios, for myself, I've never paid a dime of taxes on dividends because I've not received them. And again, if I paid earnings yields of seven, eight, nine at the times that I've bought it, the majority of my return has come from what Berkshire has managed to do with the retained earnings. It's the return on incremental capital that's so important in our industry and our business that I think is oftentimes so underappreciated and those who want to understand how it's done right, you've got this canvas that goes back almost 60 years. If you're a young investor learning how to invest, read the Chairman's letters back to 1977. There's so much learning that's taking place. I learned so much about the right way to run a business and to think about capital. From observing Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger over all the years, CNBC has this wonderful archive of the six and a half hours of Q and A that takes place every year at the annual meeting back to 1994, when I first started going to the meeting. In 2000, my first meeting, we bought the stock for the first time in February after it had been cut in half following the genre acquisition, when everybody wanted to chase Tech, berkshire was out of fashion. They were getting a lot of heat from a lot of the shareholders for not chasing Tech, and that really was just crazy. But I always wondered, why are these cameras onto the back of the room? What are they ever going to do with all that footage? Well, they turned it over to CNBC, and they've got this wonderful archive now of transcripts and the video of the meetings that, if you're trying to learn about how capital should work, berkshire is a perfect proxy. I spend so much time in my letter on my ongoing analysis, in part because the accounting adjustments that I have to make to get to what I would call economic earnings with Berkshire the flipping, eliminating, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from the income statement and normalizing them with the earnings yield, which is conservative, eliminating the volatility in underwriting profits and assuming what I think will be a normal, long term 5% underwriting margin. You can use zero if you want, but you're eliminating the volatility. There the treatment of intangibles. Back in the day until 2002, till Faz 142, companies were writing down depreciation. Well, if you made an acquisition that made sense and wasn't impaired, why would you write down the premium that you paid for the business if the economics of what you paid were right now? We write down a lot of intangibles. Well, some intangibles decay, some do not. Berkshire's a great case study how you account for and make assumptions regarding your pension fund. You can see that in Berkshire. I go through this laundry list of adjustments to gap earnings that are just a great teaching tool. Berkshire has so many moving parts between all these subsidiaries that almost every accounting adjustment that you'd make when you break down any company can be seen through the lens of Berkshire because it's just that diversified. Obviously, it's impractical, but it sounds like a fun exercise for a 22 year old would be to take two years of their life and do nothing but build a Berkshire model. And everything that that would entail would probably be better than any NBA that you could go through education wise and applied wise. Such an interesting idea. I'm lucky. I get to spend a lot of time on campus talking to the student funds and finance students, and I love it. I love this giving back. It's why I write as long of the letters I do. I'm trying to give back. If I've learned a few things and I can teach them in my letter a little bit, it's great. But, yeah, read the chairman's letters. Read the Berkshire and reports, build the model, and I would tell any young investor, buy some Berkshire a little bit. To me, it's a better investment than the SP 500 will be over time. Charlie and Warren go back and forth on that notion, and I think when Mr. Buffett talked about the SP 500. He's never been one to puff his own stock. Charlie always pushes back and says, I think Berkshire will be better. I've got it down to in all these years. I started following the company in 1996 when they issued the B shares on the front page of the offering document. They had a four or five bullet point series of comments that said, neither Charlie Munger, our vice chairman, nor I would buy our stock at these prices. We don't think they're sufficiently undervalued. I mean, you will never, ever in the history of capital, find an offering document that tells people not to buy the stock at this price, and that's the culture of the place. Start there. And I've got it down to one week a year when I write my letter, and it takes me six or seven weeks to write the letter of that week. I've got six to seven days that it requires for me to update all my models. And I try to make all the subsidiaries tie out. And I'm trying to figure out where the equity exists in each of the businesses. And it's a little bit like a jigsaw puzzle. And I love that process, but I can do it now in a week, and then I can put it away for the rest of the year. You're obviously going to read the queues when they come out and look at what's changing in the stock portfolio, but it's a battleship or a carrier. It doesn't change that much. And all of my work on my largest holding is done in six or seven days. And there's just not a lot that changes year to year. But it is probably the best business to study if you want to learn how to invest and how to run a company morally and ethically, which really should be at the top of everybody's list, I think that is a perfect place to close."
